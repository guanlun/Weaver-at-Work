                <p>I am Guanlun, a junior in Computer Science in the Hong Kong University of Science and Techonology.</p>
                <p>Computer Science is my major and my passion. I spend hours a day learning new stuff and programming various exciting projects. Currently I am interested in computer graphics and web development.</p>
                <p>I would describe myself as a minimalistic, enthusiasic and responsible person. I like to keep things simple and elegant, basically everthing from my bedroom to my computer desktop. I'm always highly motivated and that's why people usually find me reliable.</p>
