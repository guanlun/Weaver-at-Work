                <p>I am Guanlun, a sophomore in Computer Science in the Hong Kong University of Science and Techonology (HKUST).</p>
                <p>This site, Weaver-at-Work, is my person blog, which mainly focuses on topics about computer science, especially the areas I am most interested in, including computer graphics, web development and mobile platform development. It will also contain something about graphical design, which I also find very interesting (though I'm 100% greenhand).</p>
